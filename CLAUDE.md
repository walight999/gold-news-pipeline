# CLAUDE.md — gold-news-pipeline

Project memory for Claude. Read this first when working in this repo.

## What this is

Gold/XAUUSD news intelligence pipeline. RSS + X/Twitter + ForexFactory calendar
→ score/dedup/route → **Thai LINE Flex alerts** + a **social feed → X autopost**.
Runs on GitHub Actions, state in Google Sheets, output to LINE + X. Owner trades
gold; output language is **Thai**.

- **Repo:** github.com/walight999/gold-news-pipeline (PUBLIC, MIT)
- **Sheet (state + social_feed):** docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136Lsfx0OshKXBmi1PMXWNX1w66udrZuzKX7RSL5AONQ
- **Brand X account:** @tradetongkam

## Data flow

```
RSS (16 sources) + Apify X (7 accounts) + ForexFactory
        │  fetcher.py (conditional GET) / apify_source.py
        ▼
normalize → dedup.cluster → scorer.score → router.decide
        │
        ├─► LINE: breaking / alert / digest(=newsupdate) / eod_recap / health
        │     news_alert.classify_and_rewrite (Claude Haiku → Thai), line_flex, line_client
        │     → LINE_NEWS_TARGET = "U160…(1:1),C7b49469…(group 'News Update')"
        │
        └─► social_feed sheet tab: tweet_writer composes a @tradetongkam-voice
              draft → operator types `yes` in `approved` → social_post posts to X
```

Economic **calendar + upcoming** are owned by the pipeline again as of
2026-06-24 (MIGRATED back off the GAS `newsupdate-linebot`, which is now retired
— all its triggers removed). The move to GAS was only to beat GitHub's cron
throttle on the T-15 window; cron-job.org now drives `calendar_check` every
10 min reliably 24/7, so the pipeline hits T-15 on time without GAS.
- `calendar_check` is **active for BOTH pre- and post-release**
  (`calendar.pre_release_enabled: true`). Pre = T-15 upcoming card (window
  [15,25) min, broad `pre_release_currencies` + High/Medium, deduped by sent_log
  `precal:{id}`); post = Released News (FRED actuals + XAU reaction).
- `calendar_daily` sends ONE card/day at 04:40 ICT (21:40 UTC, the "main" slot;
  the early 00:05 slot is unscheduled). Driven on time by a cron-job.org job.
- `ff_gas_thisweek`/`ff_gas_weekly` are **disabled** (they only fed the retired
  GAS; the pipeline fetches FF directly via `cal.fetch_calendar`).

## Working conventions (IMPORTANT)

- **Never push to `main` directly** — the harness blocks it. Always: branch →
  commit → `gh pr create` → `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` → back to main.
- **Run `python -m pytest tests/ -q` before every commit.** Keep it green.
- End commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Thai test strings: write test files with the Write tool (UTF-8), NOT bash
  heredocs (Windows cp874 mangles Thai).
- Best-effort side features (social_feed, apify, tweet_writer) must **never**
  crash the news run — wrap in try/except, return None/[] on failure.

## CLI modes (`python -m src.main --mode X`)

`cron` (default, RSS+Apify+route, every 5 min) · `event` (high-freq window) ·
`digest` · `eod_recap` (23:00 ICT) · `weekly_preview` (Sat) · `verify_sources`
(weekly health probe) · `maintain` (purge) · `watchdog` (self-monitor) ·
`social_post` (post approved drafts to X, cron */20) · `social_seed` (append one
test draft) · `calendar_daily` (one card/day, 04:40 ICT) · `calendar_check` (**pre- T-15 + post Released News**) ·
`scorecard` (EOD directional-accuracy of calendar verdicts → **1:1 only**, 23:45 ICT) ·
`macro` (compute + POST the multi-factor macro state to the CHUM alert-bot worker, every 6h).

## Macro push — feeding the CHUM alert-bot (Pillar C, 2026-06-28)

`--mode macro` (`macro_push.py`) computes the LIVE half of the alert-bot's
multi-factor model (the offline backtest is `backtest/multifactor.py` in the
CHUM alert-bot repo) and POSTs the latest per-asset state to the worker's
`/webhook/macro/<secret>`. The worker stores it in KV (48h TTL) and tags every
Pine signal with the macro context at alert time, so its Pillar B/C can learn
whether macro-aligned signals grade better.
- Factors fused with priors `WEIGHTS = macro .45 / tech .20 / risk .15 / news .20`
  (MUST match multifactor.py — Pillar C learns deviations FROM these). macro =
  real-yields/USD/breakeven/gold-silver; tech = EMA cross; risk = VIX/SPX; **news =
  the pipeline's edge** — net `direction_label` of recent `event_state` events
  (0 in the offline backtest, live here).
- **Env-gated + best-effort.** Inert until BOTH `MACRO_WEBHOOK_URL`
  (`https://api.justchum.com`) and `MACRO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (= the worker's
  `TRADINGVIEW_SECRET`) are set as GH secrets. A sheet-read failure just leaves
  news=0; nothing here ever blocks the news run. Workflow: `.github/workflows/macro_push.yml`.

## Scorecard — did the verdict match the tape? (Phase 1, 2026-06-26)

Each Released-News card publishes a verdict (🟢 Bullish / 🔴 Bearish / ⚪ Neutral
for gold). `run_calendar_check` now persists that call to `calibration_log`
(`predicted_dir`, `predicted_verdict_th`, `title`, `country`; key `cal:{id}`,
`first_seen_ts` = release time). The daily backfill fills `xau_return_15m` +
`xau_base_price` (XAU at release, for exact %→$). `--mode scorecard` (`scorecard.py`
pure logic) grades each call vs the actual 15m move (flat band 0.10%), writes the
daily aggregate to the `scorecard_daily` tab, and pushes a summary Flex to the
**1:1 chat only** (never the group — it's private model introspection). Accuracy =
correct/(correct+wrong); neutral calls + sub-band moves are ⚪ excluded. RSS/news
rows have no `predicted_dir` so they're naturally out of scope. Off-hours releases
with no 15m bar show as ⏳ pending, not wrong.

## Key modules

- `main.py::run_once` — the cron pipeline (fetch→normalize→cluster→score→route→send).
- `apify_source.py` — scrapes X accounts (config `x_accounts`), tweets become
  RSS-shaped entries (tier=2, role=trader_macro). Gated by `APIFY_TOKEN`.
- `news_alert.py` — Claude Haiku classify + Thai rewrite for LINE. **Do not
  repurpose for social** — keep LINE and social independent. Also owns
  `explain_calendar_release()` — short Thai "what this print means for gold"
  for Released-News cards (Claude Haiku → Gemini → None, cached in
  translation_cache `cl…` keys).
- **News Update (digest) — 6 windows, full detail (2026-06-22).** 6 rounds/day
  (04:30/08:30/12:30/16:30/20:30/00:30 ICT, `schedule.yaml::digest.slots_ict`).
  Each round scans the WHOLE 4h window from `event_state` via
  `digest.collect_window_events` (NOT just this run's fetch), sends at most
  `max_cards` (4) events, ONE full-detail Flex bubble each (headline + body
  bullets + source ref) via `line_flex.news_update_carousel`. `event_state`
  gained `title`/`summary`/`url` columns so a stored event renders without a
  re-fetch; re-classifying it is a translation_cache hit. `sent_log` digest
  rows dedup an event across rounds + against breaking/alert.
- `tweet_writer.py` — separate Claude call composing the @tradetongkam-voice
  tweet (no emoji, analytical, `#ทองวันนี้ #ข่าวทอง #เทรดทอง #ทองคำ`).
- `social_feed.py` — append-only `social_feed` sheet writer + the approval-gated
  `post_pending` (posts via tweepy when `approved`=yes & `posted` empty).
- `store.py` — Google Sheets state. `flush()` clears+rewrites whole tabs (so the
  social feed uses `append_feed`/`set_feed_cell` instead, never clobbered).
- `router.py` — ≥4.5 breaking, ≥3.5 alert (if official or ≥2 orgs), ≥2.5 digest.

## Config

- `config/sources.yaml` — `sources:` (RSS) + `x_accounts:` (Apify handles,
  intervals, cost guard). `config/keywords.yaml` (topics/scoring),
  `config/schedule.yaml` (slots, rate limits, quiet hours).

## Secrets (GitHub Actions)

`GSHEET_ID`, `GSHEET_CREDS`, `LINE_CHANNEL_TOKEN`, `LINE_NEWS_TARGET`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`, `APIFY_TOKEN`,
`GAS_WEBAPP_URL`, `GAS_WEBAPP_TOKEN`, and X: `X_API_KEY` `X_API_SECRET`
`X_ACCESS_TOKEN` `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` (OAuth 1.0a, @tradetongkam, Read+Write).

**Classifier provider chain** (`news_alert.classify_and_rewrite`): Claude Haiku
(primary) → **Gemini `gemini-2.0-flash`** (secondary, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, free tier,
same prompt+JSON contract) → literal Google-Translate fallback (`category="Other"`,
never cached). The Gemini tier exists so an Anthropic outage / monthly spend cap
no longer drops card quality — it just switches model. Optional `GEMINI_MODEL`
overrides the model id.
⚠️ `LINE_CHANNEL_TOKEN` was pasted in chat 2026-06-11 — rotation pending.

## Cost model (~ a few $/month)

- GitHub Actions: free (public repo, but `schedule:` cron is throttled to ~1 run
  every 2-4h — don't rely on tight intervals). Real 5-min cadence comes from an
  **external scheduler hitting `workflow_dispatch`** (cron-job.org), NOT the
  `schedule:` block. If `gh run list` shows only `schedule` events and morning
  (22:00-06:00 UTC) coverage drops, the external dispatcher is dead — see
  **`docs/DISPATCHER-CRON.md`** (setup + the 2026-06-23 GAS-dispatcher outage).
- Claude Haiku (rewrite + tweet voice): ~$1-3/mo.
- Apify X scraper (kaitoeasyapi): ~$0.18/1k tweets, min-interval guard → ~$2-10/mo
  of the $30 budget.
- X API posting (pay-per-use since 2026-02): **$0.015/post WITHOUT a link**,
  $0.20 WITH a link → drafts are deliberately link-free + source-free.

## Social autopost loop (operator)

News → draft lands in `social_feed` (tweet_text, @tradetongkam voice) → operator
reviews, types `yes` in `approved` for the ones to publish → `social-post` cron
(~20 min) posts to X at $0.015 and writes the tweet URL into `posted`. Nothing
posts without an explicit per-row `yes`. Docs: `docs/SOCIAL-FEED.md`.

## State as of 2026-06-11

All LIVE: news→LINE, FF-prefetch (302-redirect fixed), group delivery, social
feed + X autopost (PR #1-8), @tradetongkam tweet voice (PR #9), Apify X
fast-news (PR #10-11). Next: observe real output 1-2 days + tune handles/voice;
rotate the LINE token.
